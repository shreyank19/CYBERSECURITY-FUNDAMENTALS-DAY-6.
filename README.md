# CYBERSECURITY-FUNDAMENTALS-DAY-6.
Day 6 of my Cybersecurity Fundamentals journey covers DevSecOps, Ethical Hacking, and Penetration Testing. Focus on shifting security left in DevOps, simulating attacks to uncover vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking for proactive defense. Documenting every step at 19 to build consistency, skills, and proof-of-work.

ðŸš€ Day 6 | Cybersecurity Journey â€“ DevSecOps, Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing

At 19, Iâ€™m documenting my cybersecurity learning journey with discipline and consistencyâ€”building visible proof-of-work toward SOC L1, Incident Response, and GRC roles.
This repository contains structured notes from Day 6, covering modern security practices that combine development, offensive security, and defense validation.

ðŸ“‚ Notes :- { https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:AP:2f268763-24c0-4698-8aa9-cf7cdaf58eb6 }

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

DevSecOps
Integrating security into every stage of development and operations:

Shifting Security Left â†’ embedding controls in CI/CD pipelines

Automating security scans & compliance checks

Secure coding practices & vulnerability management

Security-as-code for infrastructure (IaC)

Faster delivery without compromising defense

Ethical Hacking
Learning to think like an attacker for proactive defense:

Reconnaissance â†’ Scanning â†’ Exploitation â†’ Post-exploitation lifecycle

Vulnerability discovery & reporting

Bug Bounty Programs & Responsible Disclosure

Red Team vs Blue Team approaches

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) for initial attack vectors

Penetration Testing
Simulated cyberattacks to assess real-world resilience:

Manual & automated testing methods

Exploiting weak configs, unpatched systems, insecure apps

Social engineering vectors (phishing, pretexting)

Penetration testing tools (Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, etc.)

Reporting with remediation-focused findings


All detailed and structured notes are available in this repository for study reference, interview preparation, and professional documentation.

ðŸ“– Learning Goals for Day 6

Understand how DevSecOps integrates security within modern development pipelines

Gain clarity on ethical hacking methodology & its real-world applications

Learn penetration testing lifecycle for practical readiness

Build strong foundations in both offensive and defensive security skills
